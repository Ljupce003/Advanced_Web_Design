### Core Vue concepts

#### v-bind
It is used for dynamically binding a value or a prop to an expression. Used when we want a dynamic value instead of a static string.
 

#### v-model
It is used for *two-way binding* between forms or components and the Vue data. Means that it reads a value from the dataand displays it, but also changes the data in Vue when it is changed on the *displaying side* . It is syntatic sugar for *<u>v-bind</u>* and *<u>v-on</u>*. For custom components , Vue maps *v-model* to: props(usually *modelValue*) or a emited event
